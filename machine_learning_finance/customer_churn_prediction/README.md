## Model Approach
### ðŸŽ¯ **Prediction Models**
- **Random Forest**: Primary ensemble model
- **Logistic Regression**: Interpretable baseline
- **SVM**: Support vector classification
- **Neural Network**: Deep learning approach
- **Ensemble**: Meta-learner combination

### ðŸ“Š **Feature Categories**
- **Demographic**: Age, location, account type
- **Behavioral**: Transaction patterns, frequency
- **Engagement**: App usage, support interactions
- **Financial**: Balance trends, fee sensitivity
- **Relationship**: Product ownership, tenure

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 88.4%
- **Precision**: 82.1% (churn identification)
- **Recall**: 76.3% (churn identification)
- **ROC AUC**: 0.912
- **Lift**: Top 10% score captures 45% of churners

## Business Applications
### ðŸ’¼ **Retention Strategies**
- **High Risk**: Personal outreach and retention offers
- **Medium Risk**: Targeted email campaigns
- **Low Risk**: General satisfaction surveys
- **Intervention Timing**: 60-90 days before predicted churn

### ðŸ“ˆ **Business Impact**
