## Detection Methods
### 🎯 **Supervised Learning**
- **Gradient Boosting**: XGBoost for known fraud patterns
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning for complex patterns
- **SVM**: Support vector machines for classification
- **Ensemble**: Multiple model combination

### 🔍 **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Isolation Forest**: Anomaly detection for unknown patterns
- **Clustering**: K-means for transaction grouping
- **PCA**: Dimensionality reduction and outlier detection
- **Autoencoders**: Deep learning anomaly detection

## Feature Engineering
### 💳 **Transaction Features**
- Amount patterns and statistical measures
- Time-based features (hour, day, season)
- Merchant category and location
- Payment method and channel

### 👤 **Customer Behavior**
- Historical transaction patterns
- Velocity checks (frequency, amount)
- Geographic patterns and deviations
- Account age and activity levels

## Performance Metrics
- **Fraud Detection Rate**: 95.2%
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.8%
- **Processing Time**: <100ms per transaction
- **Daily Transactions**: 500K+ processed
- **Cost Savings**: $8.2M annual fraud prevention

## System Architecture
- **Real-time Processing**: Apache Kafka streaming
- **Model Serving**: REST API with load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts and dashboards
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous model improvement
