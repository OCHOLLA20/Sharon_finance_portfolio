# Manufacturing Cost Analysis Solution

## Overview
Comprehensive manufacturing cost analysis system providing activity-based costing, production optimization, and operational efficiency analytics for manufacturing operations.

## Files
- `cost_analysis.py` - Manufacturing cost calculation and analysis engine
- `production_optimization.py` - Production planning and optimization algorithms
- `manufacturing_data.csv` - Sample manufacturing data (orders, production, costs)
- `cost_breakdown.xlsx` - Detailed cost analysis templates and models

## Cost Analysis Framework
### ðŸ’° **Cost Categories**
- **Direct Materials**: Raw materials, components, packaging
- **Direct Labor**: Production workers, assembly line staff
- **Manufacturing Overhead**: Utilities, maintenance, depreciation, supervision
- **Quality Costs**: Inspection, testing, rework, scrap, warranty
- **Logistics Costs**: Inbound freight, storage, outbound shipping

### ðŸ“Š **Costing Methods**
1. **Traditional Costing**: Volume-based overhead allocation
2. **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)**: Cost driver-based allocation
3. **Standard Costing**: Predetermined cost standards
4. **Target Costing**: Market-driven cost targets
5. **Lifecycle Costing**: Total product lifecycle costs

## Activity-Based Costing Implementation
### ðŸŽ¯ **Cost Drivers & Activities**
```python
